This license doesn't apply to OpenSimplexNoise.c and OpenSimplexNoise.h which have a different license
specified in OpenSimplexNoise.c. I didn't make these files I simply ported the files from Java to C.

Later I will figure out an offical license, but for now use this.


TO COMPILE:
  This is currently only for mac and linux. It seems to work better on linux 'Konsole' then mac 'Terminal'.

  just go to directory and run:
    make


  On mac you might need to remove the -lm from the last line in the makefile
